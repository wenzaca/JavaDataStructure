/*
1) Overloaded methods are bonded using static binding in Java. Which occurs during compile time i.e. when you compile Java program. During the compilation process, compiler bind method calls to the actual method.

2) Overloaded methods are fast because they are bonded during compile time and no check or binding is required during runtime.

3) Most important rule of method overloading in Java is that two overloaded methods must have a different signature. Here is an example ofÂ What does method signature means in Java:

1) A number of argument to a method is part of method signature.
2) Type of argument to a method is also part of method signature
3) Order of argument also forms part of method signature provided they are of different type.
4) The return type of method is not part of the method signature in Java.
